Welcome to this code! Here, I've brought a design system 🎨 from Figma to life. 🧟

## Features

In this project, I've utilized these tools ⛏️:

- 🏎️ **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** - Fast by default, with configurations optimized for performance (with the **App Directory**).
- 💅 **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- ✨ **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** and **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** - For clean, consistent, and error-free code.
- 🛠️ **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - For type safety.
- 🚀 **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** - To deploy the project.
- 💯 **Perfect Lighthouse score** - Because performance matters.
- 🧪 **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)** and **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react)** - For rock-solid unit and integration tests.
- 📖 **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** - Create, test, and showcase your components.
- 🍝 **[Absolute imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases)** - No more spaghetti imports.
- 🎨 **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)** - Headless UI components for endless customization.
- 🟪 **[CVA](http://cva.style/)** - Create a consistent, reusable, and atomic design system.

## How to navigate this project

You can navigate to `src/ui`, where all the components, their tests, and stories are located.

## If I had more time, I would change this

- There is an issue with Radix UI, and accessibility is at 92% in Lighthouse. While this is a good number, replacing buttons with normal radio and switches could achieve a 100% score.
- I'd like to create some examples using the components to better showcase them.
